# Hotel_Cancelation

In this project, I aimed to develop a robust classification model to predict whether a given customer is likely to cancel their hotel reservation. Leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, I meticulously explored and processed the dataset, considering factors such as lead time, booking changes, and customer demographics. Employing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors, I conducted an in-depth evaluation of their performance, utilizing metrics such as accuracy and precision. Furthermore, for a comprehensive understanding, I visualized the model outcomes through confusion matrices and t-SNE scatter plots, providing insights into the complex relationships within the data. This project not only aims at building a predictive model but also focuses on the interpretability and visual representation of the classification results, contributing to a more thorough and actionable analysis of hotel reservation cancellations.
